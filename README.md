# SSR Example - React 17

# Overview

![](running-localhost4000.png)

I am looking back over React techniques as I prepare to transition to React 18.  This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwyQONeqRXA) is a simple example of the process of server side rendering in React.  I found a great [blog](https://blog.saeloun.com/) in the course of looking at this topic in React.  I hope to do something more involved in React with server side rendering in the future.
